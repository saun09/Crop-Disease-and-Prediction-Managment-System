## Project Description
This AI-driven system leverages image classification and predictive modeling to detect diseases in crops like cotton, maize, wheat, and sugarcane. Farmers can upload crop images through a mobile or web application to receive real-time disease predictions and actionable treatment recommendations. Using transfer learning with the InceptionV3 model, decision trees, and TensorFlow Lite for deployment, the platform aims to enhance agricultural productivity, reduce crop losses, and empower farmers with data-driven insights in their preferred local language.

## Introduction
We have developed a system that uses AI to predict crop diseases from images and environmental data, aiming to help farmers detect issues early and take effective action. By incorporating mobile and web-based platforms, we provide a simple and accessible tool for farmers to receive accurate diagnoses and treatment recommendations. Our goal is to reduce crop losses, minimize pesticide misuse, and promote sustainable farming practices through innovative technology

## Features 

- **Disease Detection**  
  Identify diseases in cotton, maize, wheat, and sugarcane through AI-powered image analysis.  

- **Real-Time Predictions**  
  Provides instant results with confidence scores for uploaded images.  

- **Treatment Recommendations**  
  Offers precise solutions to reduce crop losses and improve productivity.  

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Designed with multilingual support for seamless farmer interaction.  

- **Offline Mode**  
  Enables functionality in low or no internet connectivity areas.  

- **Data Insights**  
  Analyzes disease trends for better decision-making in agriculture.  

- **AI-Powered Disease Prediction**  
  Farmers can upload crop images, and the system uses advanced image processing and AI algorithms to accurately predict diseases affecting the plants.  

- **Environmental Data Integration**  
  Incorporates real-time environmental data like temperature, humidity, and soil conditions to enhance prediction accuracy and provide better insights.  

  
## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter (for mobile application)
- **Backend**: Flask (for API development and model integration)
-  Python (for AI/ML model implementation)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras (for building and training image classification models)
TensorFlow Lite (for deploying ML models on mobile devices)
- **Dataset**: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jawadali1045/20k-multi-class-crop-disease-images)

## Methodology and process implementation
![Methodology](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef20059d-b5d6-4fe6-af09-7157bfba86f5)

The following flowchart outlines the methodology for the **Crop Disease Prediction and Management System**:  

1. **Farmer Interaction**  
   - Farmers sign up or log in to the system via a user interface that supports multiple languages (English, Kannada, Hindi).  
   - They capture or upload an image of the affected crop.  

2. **Pre-Processing and Analysis**  
   - The system pre-processes the uploaded image for better analysis.  
   - Environmental data ( location, weather conditions) is integrated to enhance prediction accuracy.  

3. **Disease Prediction**  
   - Disease prediction model analyzes the processed image and environmental data to diagnose the disease.  

4. **Recommendation and Feedback**  
   - The system provides tailored treatment recommendations based on the diagnosis.  
   - Farmers can give feedback, which helps refine the system.  

5. **Admin Oversight**  
   - Admins oversee the process and ensure the system's efficiency and updates.  

This methodology ensures accurate disease diagnosis, actionable recommendations, and a user-friendly experience for farmers.  

## Benefits  

The **Crop Disease Prediction and Management System** offers several benefits across social, economic, and environmental factors:  

- **Early Detection of Diseases**: Enables timely interventions, minimizing crop losses.  
- **Promotes Sustainable Agriculture**: Encourages the growth of pesticide-free, organic crops that are safe for consumption.  
- **Healthier Ecosystems**: Reduces soil and water contamination caused by pesticide overuse.  
- **Targeted Treatment**: Identifies the best course of action for treating crop diseases.  
- **Improved Economic Conditions**: Boosts farmers' income by reducing crop losses and lowering input costs.  
- **Enhanced Knowledge Dissemination**: Provides actionable insights, increasing farmers' awareness of crop health.  
- **Empowers Farmers**: Benefits 54.6% of the Indian population by equipping them with tools for better crop management.  
- **Raises Awareness**: Helps farmers understand and prevent potential disease outbreaks.  
- **Aids Decision-Making**: Supports informed decision-making through real-time data and recommendations.
